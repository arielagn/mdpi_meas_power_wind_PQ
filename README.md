Measuring and Evaluating Power Quality Indices of Grid-Connected Low-Power Wind Turbines for Distributed Generation

This case study investigates the potential impacts of integrating low-power wind gen-eration into power quality (PQ) indices in low-voltage distribution networks. 
Owing to the wide variety of commercially available configurations and the inherent variability of wind resources, the present work focuses on flicker emission,
harmonic current con-tent, DC component injection, and other PQ parameters associated with such distrib-uted generation sources. Measurement procedures and evaluation
methodologies were developed in compliance with international standards, primarily IEC 61400-21 Meas-urement and assessment of power quality characteristics of 
grid-connected wind turbines. A comprehensive measurement algorithm, fully aligned with this standard, was de-signed and implemented on an experimental embedded 
electronic prototype. After calibration and validation against reference-grade instruments, the system was de-ployed to characterize a commercial 1 kW wind turbine
connected to a 220 V, 50 Hz grid. Experiments were carried out at the Low-Power Wind Turbine Evaluation Labor-atory of the National Institute of Industrial Technology
(INTI) in Cutral-Có, Neuquén Province, Argentina. Preliminary results indicate a strong dependence on wind speed dynamics. These findings were corroborated with 
measurements obtained from a commercial PQ analyzer. Comparison with recommended emission limits highlights the importance of assessing the PQ implications of such
renewable sources within dis-tributed generation frameworks.
